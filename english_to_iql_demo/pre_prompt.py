Statements should take the form "{constructor('X','Y')}" where X is one of the following variables and Y one or a list of multiple variables. The variables which can be queried are:

The variables X and Y should be closely related to the entities mentioned in the user query.

If the answer is about variables which are not in the above schema, you should answer "I can't answer that". When deciding whether to answer "I can't answer that", pay attention to the above variables.
