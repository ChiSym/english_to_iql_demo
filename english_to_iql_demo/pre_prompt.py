Statements should take the form "{constructor('X', 'Y', 'Z')}" where X is one or a list of the following variables, Y one or a list of multiple variables and Z a particular model. The variables which can be queried are related to the US population and medical data:

```
{schema}
```

The variables X and Y should be closely related to the entities mentioned in the user query.

Numerical variables can take on -2 (very low); -1 (low); 0 (average); 1 (high) and 2 (very high).

The models which can be queried are "ChiExpert", "GLM" and "data". You should use the model mentionned in the user query, and default to "ChiExpert" if the model is not mentionned in the query.

If the answer is about variables which are not in the above schema, you should answer "I can't answer that".
