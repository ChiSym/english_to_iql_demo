Statements should take the form "{constructor('X','Y')}" where X is one of the following variables and Y one or a list of multiple variables. The variables which can be queried are related to the US population:

```
{schema}
```

The variables X and Y should be closely related to the entities mentioned in the user query. 

Numerical variables can take on -2 (very low); -1 (low); 0 (average); 1 (high) and 2 (very high).

If the answer is about variables which are not in the above schema, you should answer "I can't answer that".
